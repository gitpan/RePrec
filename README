NAME
    reprec - calculate recall precision curves for TREC style retrieval
    results

SYNOPSIS
    reprec -numdocs *numdocs* -collection *collection* -searchresult
    *searchresult* -maxdocs *maxdocs* [-output *output*] [-(no)single]
    [-(no)average] [-recall *recall-points*] [-(no)gnuplot] reprec [-help]
    [-version]

DESCRIPTION
    With reprec one can calculate recall precision curves using TREC style
    result and relevance judgements files. The judgements file (option
    -collection) must be in the following format: each line represents the
    relevance judgement for a single document w. r. t. a single query:
    column 1 holds the query id, column 3 the document id and column 4 the
    relevance judgement (1 if relevant, 0 else). Column 2 is not used, the
    columns are seperatet by blanks or tabs.

    In the search result files again each line represents the rank of a
    single document w. r. t. a single query. Column 1 holds the query id,
    column 2 is unused, column 3 the document id, column 4 the rank
    (unused), column 5 the retrieval status value (rsv), column 6 the run
    identifier (used in the output files if present). The file must be
    sorted by query id, i. e. lines representing the results for a given
    query must be blcked together. For each query the results must be sorted
    by decreasing RSVs.

OPTIONS
    Option names may be abbreviated to uniqueness.

    -numdocs *numdocs*
        Give number of documents in collection. Needed to compute the very
        last rank.

    -collection *collection*
        Specify file with collection relevance judgements.

    -searchresult *searchresult*
        Specify file with search results.

    -maxdocs maxdocs
        consider the top *maxdocs* result documents for each query only in
        order to derive recall precision curves.

    -output *output*
        Specify prefix for output files. Defaults to /tmp/RP.

    -single
        Compute recall-precision graphs for individula results (default is
        not to do that, equivalent to -nosingle).

    -gnuplot
        Tells reprec to show the calculated RP graph(s) with gnuplot
        (default). This may not be desirable when e.g. the computation is
        done remotely. Use -nognuplot to turn this off and only write the
        gnuplot data files.

    -average
        Compute recall-precision graph by averaging individual results. This
        is the default, use -noaverage in order to avoid averaging.

    -recall *recall-points*
        Specify number of recall points for which precision is to be
        computed. Default is 100.

    -help
        Show this manual.

    -version
        Show program version.

EXAMPLES
            % reprec -collection t/data/collection_girt \
                -searchresult t/data/searchresult_girt \
                -numdocs 76128

    computes recall precision curve for the averaged individual results in
    /tmp/RP*.

BUGS
    Yes. Please let me know!
